# Week 05 – Model Building and Evaluation

## Overview

This notebook contains the Week 05 deliverable for the FlyRank ML Internship program. The objective of this phase is to build and evaluate a machine learning model using the cleaned dataset and compare its performance against the baseline established in Week 04.

The notebook follows an honest modeling workflow, ensuring that all comparisons are made using the same dataset, train-test split, and evaluation metrics.

---

## Objectives

* Select an appropriate machine learning model for the project.
* Justify the model choice.
* Use a valid train-test split strategy.
* Compare model performance against the Week 04 baseline.
* Evaluate results using relevant metrics.
* Interpret feature importance and model behavior.
* Analyze prediction errors and limitations.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

* Load the cleaned dataset prepared during previous weeks.
* Verify dataset structure and data quality.

### 2. Feature Preparation

* Separate features and target variable.
* Handle categorical variables if required.
* Confirm data is suitable for modeling.

### 3. Train-Test Split

* Use the same split strategy established in Week 04.
* Ensure fair comparison between baseline and new model.

### 4. Baseline Evaluation

* Reproduce baseline performance.
* Record evaluation metrics for comparison.

### 5. Model Training

* Train the selected machine learning model.
* Generate predictions on the test set.

### 6. Performance Comparison

* Compare the new model against the baseline.
* Evaluate improvements and trade-offs.

### 7. Model Interpretation

* Examine feature importance.
* Identify key factors influencing predictions.

### 8. Error Analysis

* Investigate prediction errors.
* Identify patterns in model mistakes.
* Document limitations and observations.

### 9. Self-Check

* Verify methodology follows FlyRank guidelines.
* Confirm results are reproducible and properly documented.
